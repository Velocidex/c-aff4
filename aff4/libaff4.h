/**
 * Convert from a child URN to the zip member name.
 *
 * The AFF4 ZipFile stores AFF4 objects (with fully qualified URNs) in zip
 * archives. The zip members name is based on the object's URN with the
 * following rules:

 1. If the object's URN is an extension of the volume's URN, the member's name
 will be the relative name. So for example:

 Object: aff4://9db79393-53fa-4147-b823-5c3e1d37544d/Foobar.txt
 Volume: aff4://9db79393-53fa-4147-b823-5c3e1d37544d

 Member name: Foobar.txt

 2. All charaters outside the range [a-zA-Z0-9_] shall be escaped according to
 their hex encoding.

 * @param name
 *
 * @return The member name in the zip archive.
