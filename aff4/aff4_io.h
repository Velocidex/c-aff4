   Volumes allow for other objects to be stored within them.

   This means that to create an object within a volume, one must create the
   volume first, then call CreateMember() to add the object to the volume. The
   new object will be flushed to the volume when it is destroyed.

   To open an existing object one needs to:

   1) Open the volume - this will populate the resolver with the information
      within the volume.

   2) Directly open the required URN. The AFF4 resolver will know which volume
      (or volumes) the required object lives in by itself.

   Note that when using a persistent resolver step 1 might be skipped if the
